<!-- Routes -->

Firstly, I will love to thank you for the updates, changes you have made so far on this project.
1. Guess we need to make one login available for admin only, and it should redirect the admin to the adminDash, where they will see the number of users that registered.
2. the report page allow its users to send report of their waste and the admin should be able to recieve it at their end.
3. Help me modify the report page so that the user will recieve a thank you notification after making any report.
4. can we implement cloudinary to handle the images of the site, or what do you think about this project.
